Assignment for Artificial Intelligence HT2025

## Assignment report aspects 
# The problem :
The N-queen puzzle . Size of N will change and we measure the minimal steps required to reach a solution 
# the algorithm design (i.e., representation, fitness function, operations, parameter values ect ) 
We can derive a lot of our fitness function and parameter values in the constants.py section 
# An experimental setup
We will run the program and show the experimental setup and its results 
# results from the experimentation and
We will print the results in a seperate file format that is readable and in such a mannor where it is readable 
# some analysis with conclusions.
We will have someone analyse and draw conclusions on our code

## Deliverables 
# a pdf 
document with your written report where you describe the problem, the
system design (i.e., representation, fitness function, operations, parameter values,
etc.), an experimental setup, results from the experimentation, and some analysis
with conclusions.

# the numerical 
results from the experimentation saved in a text file.

# a zip 
file containing the source code for implementing a solution of an optimization
problem and the executable files.


## NOTES
Agisim and tracers for inside of the solution 
Bacteria maze solution
